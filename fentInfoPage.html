    <h1>Fent Info Page</h1>
    <p>
        Fentanyl has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands of American Lives over the past decades. Below is a graph showing Fentanyl deaths over the past 23 years. A clear
        upward trend of deaths, with more men dying than women, shows no sign of stopping. The Biden Administration was the first presidency to see a decrease in deaths in decades
        due to their support of Naxolone, a lifesaving drug that can be used to reverse opioid overdoses.

    <h2>The Sackler Family</h2>
    <p>
      The Sacklers are a very rich family that made its fortune primarily by advertising pharmacuticals. Much of their money comes from OxyContin. They advertised it as a non-addictive
      painkiller, lying about the actual addictive nature of oxy. This has caused millions of people to be prescribed opiates and many get addicted. Between 1997 and 2017, 200,000
      people in the United States have died from OxyContin overdoses, and the Sackler family is heavily responsible. This does not cover the hundreds of thousands of other lives that
      have been destroyed by opiate addiction through losing family members, losing jobs and housing and some people switching to other opiates like heroin when they can no longer
      afford or acquire OxyContin.
